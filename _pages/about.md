Greetings!

I am Xiaochen Zhu, PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, working under the supervision of Prof. [Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/). My research focuses on natural language processing, particularly large language models and dialogue systems. My current projects covers diffusion for controllable dialogue generation, multi-party dialogues, and computational social science ([Deliberation for better collective decision](https://www.delibot.xyz/)).
