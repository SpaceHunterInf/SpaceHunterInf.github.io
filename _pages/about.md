Greetings!

I am Xiaochen Zhu, and you can also call me Neo. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge, King's College, working under the supervision of [Prof. Andreas Vlachos](https://andreasvlachos.github.io/). My research focuses on natural language processing, particularly large language models and dialogue systems. My current projects explore:

- Diffusion for controllable dialogue generation
- Multi-party dialogues
- Computational social science ([Deliberation for Better Collective Decision](https://www.delibot.xyz/))

I graduated with Distinction in the MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Cambridge. Prior to that, I earned a First Class with Honours in BSc Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh, where I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Shay Cohen](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).
